## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` in main repo folder
- There are two scripts to run the app:
  - `npm start` - starts the server (needs manual restart after making changes)
  - `npm run watch` - runs webpack in watch mode (doesn't need manual restart)
- Install mongo if you want to use local db server
- Setup config file (src/config.dist.js) and change its name to config.js
